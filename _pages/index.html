<h1>hi, i'm david</h1> 

<p>im a {{ diffYears | round: 0 }}yo student from hungary.</p>

<p>i'm primarily interested in web, android app and hardware development, while also trying to break them in every way possible. i'm currently a high-school student, but next year i'll finally enroll to uni to learn ITsec in a more standardized way.</p>

<p>in my free time, i like to drink coffee, experiment with photography, and travel around the world. I visited 10+ countries in the last few years ðŸ¥º</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
