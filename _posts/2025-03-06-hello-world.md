Hey! 

If you're reading this, it means my blog works! If you're wondering, I'm using Github Pages and Jekyll in the background with some basic custom css - that's why you may see some formatting issues reading this on a mobile device. I hate frontend work :) 

At the time of writing this, I don't have much to share, but I'm sure that will change in the future. 

For now, here are some markdown tests: 

## header 2

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, ~~strikethrough~~ or `keyword`

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.


This is a normal paragraph following a header.

### Header 3

> This is a blockquote following a header.

#### Header 4

```js
const meow = eval(user_supplied_code);
console.log('pwned' + meow);
```

### Here is a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

```
The final element.
